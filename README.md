# stam.py

This repository contains the code for Stampy The Safety Bot (@Stampy). Stampyâ€™s primary purpose is to share questions from Rob Miles YouTube comments section and responses from Rob Miles AI Discord. Questions from YouTube that are interesting spark conversations on discord. Responses to the YouTube question on Discord can then be posted by Stampy as a reply to the YouTube comment.

# Discord

Discussion and planning is primarily done on Discord. You are welcome to join via [this invite](https://discord.com/invite/7wjJbFJnSN).
# Developer Set-up

1. Install Requirements:
    * [Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    * [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
1. Fork and then clone the repo
    * To fork, click the fork button on top of this page and accept default settings.
    * To clone run `git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/stampy.git`
1. Create stampy [python conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
    * Change directory to where you downloaded the stampy github
repository: `cd stampy`
    * Run `conda env create -f environment.yml` This will create an anaconda
python kernel with all the dependencies required to run the
current version of stampy.
1. Get access to appropriate channels in Discord. In the `#stampy-dev` channel, ask to be given access to:
    * `#stampy-dev-priv` channel to access the `.env` information
    * Stampy's Test Server
1. Set Environment Variables
    * In the `#stampy-dev-priv` channel, go to pinned messages, and copy the message that starts with `DISCORD_TOKEN`
    * Create `.env` in the root of the stampy repository (so [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) can find it)
    * Paste the message into `.env`
1. Verify that your setup is working
    * Run `conda activate stampy`
    * Then run `python3 stam.py` or `python stam.py` from the base directory of the repository.
      * Alternatively, if you prefer to restart stampy on any file save (and if you have NodeJS installed), you can run `npx nodemon stamp.py`.
    * Go to Stampy's Test Server, then `#stampy-dev-priv` channel.
    * You should see a message from Stampy saying `I just (re)started from git branch master by <your name>!`
    * If you ask Stampy a question (e.g. `Stampy, what is AI`), you should see messages in your terminal processing this question.
