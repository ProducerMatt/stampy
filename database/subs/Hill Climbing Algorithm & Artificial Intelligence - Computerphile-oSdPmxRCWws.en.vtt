00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.600
generally when you think about artificial intelligence

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.780
you are talking about whats the difference between

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.480
einstein and normal people

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.000
or between a normal person and a stupid person

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.500
actually it's like difference between normal person and a mouse??!

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.460
or what's the difference between mouse and a rock??

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.320
like that's the...that's the difference in ..umm ..between just levels of intelligence within humans which actually ...actually doesnt vary that much

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.680
in the grand scheme of things vs. whats intelligence is in general

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.360
one way of thinking about what intelligence is ..is

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.720
as an optimization process  .most basic of all optimization process is evolution

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:47.320
which ...umm..is looking for good replicators in the search space of animals ..right??

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.720
..or creatures..or umm..organisms..yeah..Organisms is the word!
