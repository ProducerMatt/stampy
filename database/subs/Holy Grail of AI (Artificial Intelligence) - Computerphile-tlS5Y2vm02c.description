Why can't artificial intelligence do what humans can? Rob Miles talks about generality in intelligence.

Sean Comments/Questions (For those who can't hear him clearly)
11secs: "This was the hill climbing algorithm?"
2min 40sec: "recently with Professor Brailsford we did the idea of The Turing Test, so that strikes me from what you're saying that that's a very specific domain: pretending to be a human talking?"
4min 2sec: "is that like 'humans have been changing the world to meet their needs?' "
4min 40sec: "but on a bigger scale, as you say on a grander scale, building a dam, and er irrigating a field, and putting a pipe to your house and allowing you to have a tap {fawcett} is doing the same thing but on a grander scale."
6min 39sec: "all these dimensions, if you try to brute force infinite dimensions you're gonna fall over pretty quickly?"
6min 45sec: "change the world" (in ref to him picking up the drink!)
