00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
In almost any situation being given a new utility function,

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.060
Is gonna rate very low on your current utility function.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.800
So that's a problem.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.940
if you want to build something that you can teach, that means you want to be able to change its utility function.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.940
And you don't want it to fight you.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.360
So this has been formalized, as this property that we want early AGI to have called 'corrigibility'

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.920
That is to say it is open to be corrected.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.660
It understands that it's not complete, that the utility function that it's running is not the be all and end all.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:46.640
So let's say for example you've got your AGI. It's not a super intelligence, it's just you know, perhaps around human level intelligence.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And it's in a robot in your lap.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.240
And you're testing it.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.140
But you... saw a Youtube video once that said maybe this is dangerous.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.280
So you thought, okay well we'll put a big red stop button next to it.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.620
This is the standard approach to safety with machines. Most robots in industry and elsewhere will have

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.300
a big red stop button on them.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.060
Oh yeah

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.780
Hey.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.240
I happen to have a button, of appropriate type.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.880
so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.380
and we have

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.120
we have that.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.440
So right... there you go.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.400
Alright, so, so

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.180
if only HAL would've been fitted with said stop button.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.380
Can't do that Dave, uh yes I can.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.620
except yeah, probably not.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.400
I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.360
And I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.360
That was an incorrigible design.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.360
Is this the point we're making? Kind of.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.360
You've got your big stop button,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.680
because you want to be safe. You understand it's dangerous.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.340
And the idea is if the AI starts to do anything

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.340
that maybe you don't want it to do,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.620
you'll smack the button, and if the button's like, mounted on its chest, something like that, ya know.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:18.100
So you create the thing, you set it up with a goal, and it's the same basic type of machine as the stamp collector, but less powerful.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.200
In the sense it has a goal, a thing that it's trying to maximize,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.100
and in this case, you know, it's in a little robot body

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.720
so they can tootle around your lab and do things.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.600
So you, you want it to get you a cup of tea just as a test, right?

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.160
So you set it up with this goal you manage to specify in

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.390
the bot's like in the AI's ontology

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.700
what a cup of tea is and that you

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.120
want one to be in front of you.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.940
You switch it on and it looks around, gathers

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.300
data and it says oh yeah there's a

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.010
kitchen over there it's got a kettle

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.360
and it's got teabags and this is like

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.950
the easiest way for me to fulfill this

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.050
goal with the body i have now and

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.130
everything setup is to go over there and

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.950
make a cup of tea. So far we're doing

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.560
very well right. So it starts driving over

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.210
but then oh no you forgot it's bring

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.670
your adorable baby to the lab day or

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.160
something and there's a kid

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.410
in the way. Your utility function only

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.070
cares about tea right. So it's not going

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.130
to avoid hitting the baby. So you rush

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.870
over there to hit the button

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.060
obviously as you built it in and what

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.950
happens of course is that the robot will

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.850
not allow you to hit that button because it

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.040
wants to get you a cup of tea and if you

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.050
hit the button it won't get you any tea so

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.910
this is a bad outcome so it's going to

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.260
try and prevent you in any way possible

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.210
from shutting it down

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.850
that's a problem plausibly it fights you

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.600
off crushes the baby and then carries on

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.730
and makes you a cup of tea and the fact that

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.650
this button is supposed to turn it off

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.320
is not in your utility function that you

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.840
gave it so obviously it's going to fight

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.290
you

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.030
ok that was a bad design right assuming

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.080
you're still working on the project

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.850
after the terrible accident and you have

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.380
another go try to improve things right

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.890
and rather than read any AI safety

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.660
research what you do is just come up

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.010
with the first thing that pops into your

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.620
head and you say

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.139
ok let's add in some reward for the

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.229
button so that because what it's looking

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.669
at right now is it says button gets

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.180
hit i get 0 reward. Button doesn't get

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.970
hit if I manage to stop them then I get

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.530
the cup of tea i get like maximum reward

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.669
if you give some sort of compensation

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.320
for the button being hit maybe it won't

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.389
mind you hitting the button. If you give it

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.310
less reward for the button being hit

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.490
than for getting tea, it will still fight you

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.919
cause it will go well I could get five reward

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.330
for accepting your hitting the button

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.010
but I could get 10 for getting the tea

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.449
so I'm still gonna fight you.

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.310
The button being hit has to be just as

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.620
good as getting the tea so you give it the

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.060
same value right so so now you've got a

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.150
new Version 2. You turn it on

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.039
and what it does immediately is shut

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.510
itself down because that's so much

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.190
quicker and easier than going and

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.100
getting the tea and gives exactly the

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.180
same reward

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.979
Why would it not just immediately shut

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.020
itself down? So you've accidentally

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.120
made like a dramatically suicidal robot.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.250
We're kind of back to the Three Laws of

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.500
Robotics again but could you presumably

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.780
say well the robot is not allowed to to

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.180
shut itself down or something like that? Right

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.930
yeah so. It's still a reward if it does

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.310
so it's not gonna fire you but it's not

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.470
allowed to do itself i'm guessing that's

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.449
a possibility. The robot cares about

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.760
things in the real world and the button

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.370
whether it's pushed or not has a big

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.470
effect on the things that the robot cares

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.380
about which means that the robot cares

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.199
about the button so either it's trying

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.150
to stop you from pressing the button or

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.880
it's trying to press the button. Either

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.860
way that's not what you want

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.560
so suppose then you don't mount the

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.080
button on its chest where it can hit it

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.289
right. You put the button somewhere only

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:15.910
you can hit it somehow you managed to

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:21.310
completely isolate the bot from the

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.110
button. It's a fingerprint scanner or something?

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.760
It's yeah it's something that it can't do

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.750
itself right. It still either wants to

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.900
press the button

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.610
or wants the button not to be pressed but now

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.130
the only path is through you

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.400
so it's now incentivised to manipulate

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.460
you to deceive you to lie to you in some

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.520
way either to cause you to not press it to

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.440
cause you to press it if you somehow

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.970
managed to persuade it it's not allowed to

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.330
interact with the button itself so in

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.860
the case where it wants the button not

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.430
to be pressed it has a reason to deceive

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.039
you so in this example it would steer

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:03.110
around the baby it would avoid the baby

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.030
assuming it has basic level of

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.970
intelligence to know you don't want it

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.979
to hit the baby and moreover if you

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:13.130
realize your mistake you will hit the

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:13.729
button

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:15.530
shut it down and change it which it

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.160
doesn't want so it will behave as though

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.750
this is a there's a term which i

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.580
like to use here i'm not sure if I

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.960
should just use it because it's my own

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.380
which is that it will Volkswagen you.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.639
That it will set itself up so

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:36.979
that it it behaves properly in the

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:39.650
testing environment despite the fact

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.680
that it actually shouldn't pass the

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.830
test. You're testing it to see if it

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.220
avoids running over babies. So

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.479
you're trying to see does it care about

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:53.720
harming humans but actually all it

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.220
cares about is you not hitting the

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.150
button and so then you might end up in a

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.840
situation in which you become convinced

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.849
that the thing is perfectly safe because

00:08:04.849 --> 00:08:06.530
it keeps passing all of your moral

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.030
puzzles and test that you give it but

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.669
actually it's just has enough of an

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:12.500
understanding of your psychology to tell

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.289
what it thinks you've put in and what it

00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:18.320
wants of what you want rather so it will

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.220
for as long as that button is able to

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.190
shut it down it will continue to attempt

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.659
to deceive you until it's in a

00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:28.370
situation in which it believes it can't

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.020
be shut down and then you have a problem

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.719
on the other side if you accidentally

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:34.039
make something that wants the button to

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.219
be hit but is unable to it is going to

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:39.050
try and manipulate you into pressing the

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.360
button so if you create your thing you

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:41.969
say okay

00:08:41.969 --> 00:08:45.240
make me a cup of tea if the button is

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.680
hit shut yourself down

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.920
you aren't allowed to shut yourself down

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.870
you aren't allowed to hit the button but if

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.490
the button is hit the reward you get is

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.709
just as good at getting the tea so that

00:08:55.709 --> 00:08:58.620
you don't have a preference this machine

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.720
really wants to hit it's own button because

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.220
that's as good as getting the tea so

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.319
what it's likely to do probably is just take a

00:09:04.319 --> 00:09:06.329
swing at you or something just

00:09:06.329 --> 00:09:08.040
immediately because if it can quickly

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.839
persuade you to hit the button if

00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:11.490
scaring you into hitting the button is

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.500
easier than getting the tea it will just

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.250
do that instead which is a really kind

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.100
of unexpected outcome that you've made

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.509
this thing with perfectly reasonable

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:23.639
sounding rewards and what it does

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:26.370
immediately is try to terrify you

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.589
it reminds me of the proverbial carrots

00:09:28.589 --> 00:09:30.240
and a stick this this is almost like this

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.889
is the stick and actually we need to

00:09:31.889 --> 00:09:33.930
find what the carrot is would that be a

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.009
fair thing to say

00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:37.500
yeah yeah you want it to actually want

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.129
it it's interesting because it has

00:09:41.129 --> 00:09:44.939
to not care about whether the button is

00:09:44.939 --> 00:09:47.759
pressed right because it has to take

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:49.620
no steps to try and cause the button to

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.600
be pressed and take no steps to try and

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.949
prevent the button from being pressed

00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:56.009
but nonetheless really care that the

00:09:56.009 --> 00:10:00.029
button exists so one thing that you

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:01.769
can do something slightly more sensible

00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:07.529
is you define the utility function such

00:10:07.529 --> 00:10:10.199
that the whole part of of what it's

00:10:10.199 --> 00:10:11.519
really trying to achieve in the world

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:15.000
and the part about paying attention to

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.230
the button being pressed and turning

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.470
itself off and it sets it up so that

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.290
those it adds an adjustment tab so that

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.110
those are always exactly equal however

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.079
however much value it would get from

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:29.639
either it being pressed it not being

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:31.860
pressed it normalizes those so that it's

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.379
always completely indifferent to whether

00:10:34.379 --> 00:10:35.819
the button is being pressed. It just doesn't

00:10:35.819 --> 00:10:36.290
care

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.149
so that way it will never try and hit

00:10:38.149 --> 00:10:40.100
the button on its own it will never try

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.269
and prevent you from hitting the button

00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:44.899
that's the idea that's a fairly sensible

00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:47.029
approach it has some of its own problem

00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:51.110
feels like a really complicated thing to

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.279
evaluate to be honest

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:53.990
yeah firstly yeah it is kind of tricky

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.329
and you have to get it right but that's

00:10:56.329 --> 00:10:59.630
always the always part of this but one

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.980
thing that's interesting about that is

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.649
that it isn't what's called subagent

00:11:03.649 --> 00:11:07.519
stable so this is something that is a

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:09.170
desirable property and it's part of

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.120
corrigibility in fact which is that

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.769
the if there's some property that the

00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:20.029
agent has you want it to if it makes

00:11:20.029 --> 00:11:23.060
any new agents that they will have this

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.329
property as well so you get some of that

00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:28.399
for nothing like in the same way that

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:29.899
you don't want to take a pill that will

00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:32.480
make you want to kill your kids

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.980
you also don't want to make a clone of

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.389
yourself that wants to kill your kids right if

00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:37.190
you're making another instance of

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.529
yourself or you're creating some agent

00:11:39.529 --> 00:11:42.319
you want it to want what you want this

00:11:42.319 --> 00:11:45.319
is like the usual classic disney way out

00:11:45.319 --> 00:11:47.899
of a problem for a baddie character where

00:11:47.899 --> 00:11:49.519
they go I'm not allowed to do this but that

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:51.199
doesn't mean I can't get this person to

00:11:51.199 --> 00:11:52.370
do this for me

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.260
I need a young pair of legs and a strong

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
back to go in after it

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.720
exactly so in general when an AI designs

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.560
its successor it will design it with the same utility function as it has for

00:12:04.569 --> 00:12:07.660
the same reason but unlike with some

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.910
safety measures where the AI will be

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.999
explicitly motivated to remove the

00:12:12.999 --> 00:12:15.129
safety measures if it can by making new

00:12:15.129 --> 00:12:17.230
agents which doesn't follow them in this

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.629
case it doesn't care so you might think

00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:21.160
well you're okay then it doesn't care it

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.509
won't remove the safety precautions but

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:24.730
it also won't to put in any effort to

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.459
keep them so if it's making a new

00:12:27.459 --> 00:12:29.079
version and it would take a couple of

00:12:29.079 --> 00:12:30.579
extra seconds to put in

00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:32.259
oh and also respond appropriately to the

00:12:32.259 --> 00:12:34.120
button and it could do anything else

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.529
with that time or those resources it

00:12:35.529 --> 00:12:37.300
just won't do it because it looks at the

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.610
utilities and says if the button is pressed

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.860
i get x utility if the button isn't

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.809
pressed i get exactly the same utility

00:12:43.809 --> 00:12:46.180
this bit of code does nothing there's no

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.589
point in it right this is going to be

00:12:47.589 --> 00:12:50.319
optimizing itself or optimizing its

00:12:50.319 --> 00:12:52.809
successor in a way that

00:12:52.809 --> 00:12:55.059
yeah it think is being

00:12:55.059 --> 00:12:57.129
streamlining potentially but actually

00:12:57.129 --> 00:12:59.259
is missing the point of and that's

00:12:59.259 --> 00:13:02.529
kind of unavoidable if you give if you

00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:03.939
have a situation in which it wants to

00:13:03.939 --> 00:13:06.069
preserve the button so that it can be

00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:07.569
pressed because it wants that then you've

00:13:07.569 --> 00:13:08.709
made something that wants the button to

00:13:08.709 --> 00:13:11.559
be pressed and will try and manipulate you if

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:13.269
you if you do it the other way you know

00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:14.680
whichever way you do it you have

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.309
problems

00:13:15.309 --> 00:13:17.769
another thing that people have thought

00:13:17.769 --> 00:13:19.540
you know as a suggestion of something

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.790
you might try in this situation is to

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.850
just have the robot have the AI not know

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.920
about the button. Oh so keep it a secret

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.230
right you have it hidden somewhere you

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.149
know the the machine is being observed

00:13:31.149 --> 00:13:34.180
from somewhere else and they have the

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.980
button and it's outside of their control

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.610
and they don't even know the button exists

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.439
so they're not going to be motivated to

00:13:41.439 --> 00:13:42.730
try and deceive you because they're not

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.980
aware that you have the capacity to

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.699
shut them down and change them. There are

00:13:48.699 --> 00:13:52.350
a few different variants of this but

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.030
at the core of the problem there you've

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.160
got the fact that you're building a

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.820
general-purpose machine to learn and

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.540
reason about the real world of uncertain

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.620
abilities

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:09.300
I suppose I mean even a very simple

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.490
optimization systems consistently

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:15.810
surprise people and so the idea that you

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.620
could reliably keep such a thing a

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.230
secret indefinitely and it would never

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.510
put two and two together in fact while

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.820
you're while you're improving it and

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.230
training it's going to be learning about

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:29.580
human psychology because that's

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.920
important for the final goal. It needs to

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.800
understand humans in order to understand

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.270
what humans want in order to do what humans

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.990
want so the idea that it's never

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.980
going to think oh interesting these guys

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.080
you know they don't seem to trust me i'm

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.760
aware there is this concept of an off

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.620
button and it's weird that they haven't

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.740
given me one so maybe they have actually

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.840
and just not told me about it that kind

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.300
of hypothesis shouldn't take too long to

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.960
occur and of course if you've designed

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.960
the thing in an incorrigible way it

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.430
won't let you know that it's figured out

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.720
that you have an off button and will  just

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.080
deceive you as it always had so that's the

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.030
kind of thing which is which could work

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.270
but it's not really a reliable solution

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.580
the other thing that people sometimes

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:22.080
suggest and this happens this happens in

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.940
conversation sometimes is that people

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.390
keep applying patches you have a you

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.240
have a bad idea for a way to do this and

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.430
then somebody points out the way that

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.140
would go wrong and then rather than

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.720
realise the big core approach is flawed

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.940
you apply a patch you say oh well we'll

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.190
also add a negative term for doing that

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.740
and then also for doing that you know

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.370
The spaghetti code ensues yeah yeah and

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:48.930
what's more you're then in a situation

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.720
in which you've got this system that you

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.730
believe you've patched every possible

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:54.450
way

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:59.100
it's it's kind of um you haven't proved

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.600
it's safe you've just proved that you

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.290
can't figure out how it's dangerous but

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.709
what are the chances that you've

00:16:07.709 --> 00:16:09.720
genuinely thought of every possibility

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.300
ideally we really want to be able to

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.130
formally prove that the system has these

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.110
properties you don't want a system in

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.600
which you've blocked off loads of

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.550
specific actions that the AI can do

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.600
and you're just relying on it it's

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.519
like running a complicated search trying

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:27.899
to figure out a way to screw you over

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:29.699
and you're pretty sure you've blocked

00:16:29.699 --> 00:16:34.500
off all the angles. You've kind of failed

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.329
before you've begun there that your code

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:38.819
is running this extensive search that

00:16:38.819 --> 00:16:42.389
you just hope fails and if it finds any

00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:43.769
way to do it will jump on that

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:44.579
opportunity

00:16:44.579 --> 00:16:46.259
it's not it's not a good way of going

00:16:46.259 --> 00:16:48.569
about things the other point about this

00:16:48.569 --> 00:16:53.399
is that the button is a toy

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:55.589
problem it's a simplification that's

00:16:55.589 --> 00:16:57.540
useful for thought experiments because

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.180
it lets you express your you know it lets you

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.560
formalize things quite well you only

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.389
have two possible outcomes you hit

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:06.089
the button or you don't hit the button but in

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:08.040
fact with corrigibility what we want is a

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.829
more complex range of behaviors we

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:13.110
want it to actually assist the

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:15.030
programmers in its own development

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.540
because if it has you know it has some

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.669
understanding of its own operation you

00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:23.280
want it to be able to actually point out

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.459
your mistakes to you or seek out new

00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:28.980
information perhaps if you say something

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.200
ambiguous rather than just assuming to

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.520
say well do you mean this or do you

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.169
mean this or if you if you believe that

00:17:37.169 --> 00:17:39.330
you've been programmed poorly to

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.150
actually draw the programmer's attention to

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.010
what may be the mistake rather than like

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.950
quietly storing that away for any time

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.960
that they might try and press this button on you

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.620
you know

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.510
likewise wanting to maintain and repair

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.490
the safety systems and so on these are

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.659
these are more complicated behaviours than

00:17:57.659 --> 00:17:59.159
just not stopping you from pressing the

00:17:59.159 --> 00:18:00.809
button and not trying to manipulate you

00:18:00.809 --> 00:18:05.309
into not pressing the button so there are

00:18:05.309 --> 00:18:07.740
some things that might work as solutions

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.500
for this specific case but you would

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.200
hope that a really good solution to the

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.770
off button problem would if you run it in a more

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.750
complicated scenario also produce these

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.000
good more complicated behaviours in

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.200
that situation so that's part of why

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.990
there are some things that maybe are

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:29.280
solutions to this problem but they're

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.980
not they're not they're only solutions

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.049
to this specific instance of the problem

00:18:34.049 --> 00:18:35.640
rather than the general issue we're trying

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.240
to deal with right now we have a few

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:46.650
different proposals for ways to ways to

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:52.350
create a AGI with these properties

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.840
but none of them are without problems

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.720
none of them seems to perfectly solve

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.840
all of these properties in a way that we

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.440
can be really confident of. So this is

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:09.809
considered an open problem so I kind of

00:19:09.809 --> 00:19:13.289
like this as a place to go from the

00:19:13.289 --> 00:19:15.059
previous thing because it gives I think

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.600
it gives people a feel for where we are

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.440
the types of problems that it seems like

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.900
the simplest thing in the world right

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.960
you've got a robot with a button

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.210
how do you make it not stop you from

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.130
hitting the button but also not try and

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.500
persuade you to hit the button

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.140
that should be easy and doesn't seem like it is

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.980
so utility function is what the AI

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.770
cares about so the the stamp collecting

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.600
device its utility function was just how

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.150
many stamps in a year

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.220
this is kind of like its measure is it

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.590
yeah it's what it it's the thing that

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.580
it's trying to optimize
