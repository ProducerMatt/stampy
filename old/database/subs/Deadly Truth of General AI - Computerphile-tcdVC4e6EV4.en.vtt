00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:03.110
in a very basic sense if you've got a

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.660
general intelligence which therefore has
preferences over world states

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.670
and take actions in the world to change
the world

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.519
we have to make sure that its
preferences are aligned with ours

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.419
that it wants what we want.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.820
because otherwise it's gonna try and do things
that we don't want it to do.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.660
that's the basic idea...

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.340
(sci-fi comes to the fore we're talking things like terminator, matrix,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.740
that machines take over the world

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.560
I for one salute our new robot overlords)

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.980
it makes it difficult to think about the problem right?

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.210
when things happen in fiction it's
generally what would make a better story

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.280
rather than what would actually happen
and I think a

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.289
a realistic "AI takes over the world"-type
story

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.309
might not be any fun to read. So on the
one side

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.480
this stuff is difficult to think about
because of fiction, because we've all been

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.020
exposed to something similar to these
ideas before

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.940
the other side that makes this difficult
to think about is anthropomorphism

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.670
because we are talking about general
intelligence

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.619
so we're going to compare it to the
examples in general intelligence that we

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:06.070
have

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.540
which is human minds and human minds and artificial general intelligences

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.979
need not be
anything alike

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.409
in the same way that a plane is not
similar to a bird

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.560
a supersonic fighter jet is a threat to
you in a way that

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.119
no bird is. It's not a useful comparison to
make in fact

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.590
but when you say oh it's a thing it has
wings and it flies and people

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.970
who don't know anything about planes immediately
to go to birds

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.280
(presumably machine could be much more selfish than
we can ever imagine)

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.080
absolutely, the space of minds in general is vast

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.180
I like this because we've already talked
about spaces so I can do this. If you

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.030
take the space at all possible minds

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.320
it's huge and then it somewhere within
that, you have the space of all minds

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.369
that biological evolution can produce

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.720
and that's also huge somewhere within
that you have the space of

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.860
actual minds that exist which is much
smaller but still huge

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.409
within that, you've got human minds right
and they're a tiny, they're a

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.460
minuscule dot on a minuscule dot on a
minuscule dot of the

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.290
actual possibilities for intelligence
that exist and

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.800
a general intelligence that we create is
from a completely different part of the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.230
space

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.640
and it's extremely tempting to anthropomorphise

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.010
more so even than in another context
because

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.870
it's a thing that's demonstrably
intelligent that makes plans that takes

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.000
actions in the real world

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.020
but it need not think

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.250
anything like us and it's a mistake to
think a bit

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.099
as basically a person because it isn't one.
So there's actually really good example

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.440
that we can use. It's sort of a thought
experiment

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.910
This is not a machine that could
practically speaking be built

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.019
this is an example of at artificial
general intelligence

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.800
which is specified an overview

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.250
and it gives you something to think
about when you're thinking about

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.000
artificial general intelligences that
makes it distinct from

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.629
a sort of anthropomorphized human type
intelligence

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.989
So the story is there's a

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.120
a stamp collector who is also an AI

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.780
programmer and he decides he would like to
collect a lot more stamps

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.709
so he's gonna write an AI to do this
for him. So he builds a machine

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.489
he has some startling insight into
general intelligence and he builds this

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.099
machine

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.260
which is connected to the Internet,
right?

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.690
so the the rules for this system are

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.349
pretty straightforward. first thing, it's
connected to the Internet and it will

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.890
send and receive data

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.940
for one year. So, he's given himself a
one-year time

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.190
window within which to collect stamps
the second thing is

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.239
it has an internal model of reality , of
the universe

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.870
this is the thing that's a bit magic we
don't really know how to build an

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.590
accurate

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.860
model of reality. The point is this
allows it to

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.159
make accurate predictions about what
will happen if it does different things

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:59.189
the third thing is for every possible
sequence of packets it could send

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.700
it uses its model to predict

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.010
how many stamps it ends up with at the
end of that and then

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.239
the fourth thing is it outputs as its

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.650
actual data to the Internet

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.070
whichever output it has predicted will
produce the most stamps

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.959
you can see here

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.340
that this has all the properties of a
general intelligence

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.419
it has an internal model of reality. It
has

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.740
a utility function or an evaluation
function, which is the number of stamps,

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.750
and the optimization is

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.870
extremely simple and like so much in
computer science there

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.009
the simple things to specify are the hard
things to compute

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.600
it looks at every possible output data
in other words every

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.320
every point in that space and it picks
out

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.560
the highest one. So this is a kind of magic
intelligence

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.810
that takes the entire space at once
finds the highest point and says

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.610
that one. Which means it's an
extremely powerful intelligence

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.729
right it is you could say it's extremely
intelligent

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.090
the question is how does this machine
behave? Well, we can look at certain

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.789
possible sequences of outputs

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.190
and see how they fare in it's evaluation
criteria.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.030
first off,  the vast majority of output
sequences are complete junk

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.229
right it's spewing random data on to the
network. nothing happens

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.309
of any consequence.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.699
No stamps get collected. Those are all rated zero.

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.500
but suppose one of the possible
sequences

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.000
a sends a request to a server let's say

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.050
eBay, that results in a bid on some stamps,

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.409
right? When that happens, 
there's a thing of 20 stamps

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:38.699
so that output is rated 20. 
This is the kind of thing that

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.659
the stamp collector machine's creator
was expecting to happen

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:45.990
So then that's good, 20 stamps

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.580
suppose it could do that lots of times.
it could send out bids for example to

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.630
30 different stamp collectors on eBay
and buy 30 sets of different stamps

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.789
and that's even better, right? That would be 
rated even higher, but the thing is that

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.570
particularly highly rated options in
this search space

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.690
are probably things that the

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.729
stamp collecting device's creator did not
think of

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:14.050
and did not anticipate. So for example
when he made it, he will have presumably given

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.840
it his credit card details or something so
they could engage in these bids

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.220
but ultimately it's searching every
possible sequence of outputs. It needn't use

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.030
his credit card

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.500
it needn't use money at all. There's
a huge variety of things that it could do here.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.720
So it might send out an enormous number of
emails to all the stamp collectors in the

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.300
world

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.320
and convince them through persuasive
argument that

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.560
he is opening a museum and wants to
exhibit their stamps

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.530
It may build a fake website for that
whatever is necessary

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.210
it can predict the world, right. It has an
internal model of reality that internal

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.410
model of reality

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.510
includes the people right. In the same
way that its modeling

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.340
people to understand that if it bids
on this

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.919
offer, then a human being will mail the
stamps to them. They understand this

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.110
email might get more people to send
stamps for example that something

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.760
but then what exactly is a stamp? 
How is this defined?

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.500
What counts as a stamp?

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.280
if it's already written the sequence 
of outputs that collects

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.500
all of the stamps in the world you think
you're done, right? You built this machine

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.160
suddenly is collected all the stamps in
the world.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.880
No, there could be more stamps within a year.
We've got time to print more stamps

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.139
so maybe it hijacks the world's stamp printing
factories and puts them into overdrive

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:28.220
producing stamps

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.220
as many as you possibly can in that time
or perhaps

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.669
it writes a virus and it hijacks all
the computers in the world to get all of

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:37.919
the printers in the world to do nothing
but print stamps.

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:41.640
that's even better right?
The highest-rated

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.800
outcomes for this machine 
are not good for people

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.570
There comes a point when the stamp
collecting devices thinking

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.820
okay what are stamps made of?

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.770
they're made of paper. Paper is made of 
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.880
I'm gonna need all of that I can get to
make stamps

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.289
and its gonna notice that people are
made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen

00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:06.180
right. There comes a point where the
stamp collecting device becomes

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.550
extremely dangerous

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:15.340
and that point is as soon as you switch
it on.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.880
So this is just a thought experiment example where we take a sort of maximally powerful intelligence

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.870
and see how it behaves so that we can
think about

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.360
how powerful intelligence has behaved
and most importantly

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.270
how they are not like people
