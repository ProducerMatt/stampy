Sean: In November 2014, I made a video about free software and did some video editing

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.360
And then erm people have said "Since would you ever go back to video editing with free software?"

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.780
And erm I tried and failed miserably but I found that Rob is doing editing on free software

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.100
Sean: So Rob what have you got?

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.640
Rob: Erm well so I before I started my channel. I'd never edited a video at all.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.040
Erm so I just got started with KDEnlive. Is it K D E n live? I don't know how to pronounce it.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.600
Sean: I said KDEnlive cause this is the piece of software I used actually

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.560
Rob: Oh right and that's kinda why I used it

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.420
Because I hadn't gotten into open source video editing before. I heard it was fairly good the one you used. So I went for that

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.260
Sean: How does it work?

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.340
Rob: So that's a video that I just ehm just uploaded recently

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.180
Which is fairly typical

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.020
No, I think it's quite standard but on the other hand

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.500
I have no idea because I'd never done video editing before

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.320
Sean: Well for my (some word, please complete) that looks like a very sensible looking timeline

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.580
So you're using different tracks for different things
