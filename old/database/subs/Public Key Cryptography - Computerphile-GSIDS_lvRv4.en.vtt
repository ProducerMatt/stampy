00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
The thing I wanted to talk about today, um...

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.520
One of the things

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.820
is a.. the coolness that is public-private key cryptography

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.420
The basic idea of how it works

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.440
I think is uh...

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.460
is just cool and such clever idea that I want to explain it

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.820
So everyone is familiar with the basic idea of crypto, where

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.040
you umm

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.740
You have a secret key

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.140
You used that to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.700
encode some information which converts it from a readable format to

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.640
garr

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.160
garbage effectively

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.360
ah.. it looks like a random noise

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.540
You then transfer it to somebody else

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and they then able to decrypt it and get the message out

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.100
and anyone who is listening here on your communication

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.220
um...

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.920
isn't able to find out anything about the information that you are communicating

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.820
the way

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.660
you intuitively think about, especially if you

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.000
doing these simple codes, something like caesar cypher that you might do

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.580
when you are a kid

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.600
there's one

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.520
there's one secret that you both have, right, this...this is a symmetric system

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.640
so you have got

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.320
your message saying HELLO

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.500
and then you do some process to it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.460
to convert it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.420
using a key

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.600
that some secret piece of information

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.020
which then converts this into nonsense

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.680
and then you send this

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.860
to the other person

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.340
and they decrypt it

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.180
with the process that kind of same process in reverse

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.600
using the same key

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.940
and then again HELLO

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.840
backout at the other end

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.320
and that's nice and simple it works

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.660
um... and it was once

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.300
sort of only way people did this

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.400
but it has a problem which is

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.520
you both need to know what this key is

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.800
so if it is you and me. And we want to communicate with one another privately

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.440
we have to agree on  a key

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.800
that's nobody else gonna guess

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.760
and we have to share it with one anther

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.620
um

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.600
so  we might meet in the park in secret and exchange envelopes

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.420
or whatever

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.340
this is the kind of things spy used to do, right

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.180
and the problem with that is

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.640
first its very inconvinient

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.340
second, you sometimes can't do it, might be physically separated

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.540
or we want to do something over internet

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.880
and we never met

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.460
the problem is that how do I send this key to you

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.380
without just sending the key in the clear, as  it were unencrypted

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.720
inorder for us to share the key safely

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.920
we need a secure encrypted connection

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.400
but we can't establish a secure encrypted connection without a key

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.320
there's a way of solving this problem

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.520
which is asymmetric encryption

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.480
um...where what you do is generate two keys

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.320
key a

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.500
and key b

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.500
let's just call then and i m drawing a line

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.140
asymmetric system you have two keys

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.020
and then basically it's same as before

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.920
you have got your message

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.500
says hello

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.740
you encrypt it with key a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.180
to say

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.860
whatever it was that I decided it was

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.500
and then back out you get HELLO again

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.660
and decryption in this case uses key b

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
you can't guess one key from other

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.760
but they are linked in such a way that

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.400
anything you encrypt with key a can only be decrypted with key b

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.900
and anything you encrypt with key b can only be decrypted with key a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.060
so there's two

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.520
and what you do is

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.180
you generate a pair of these keys, which is called key pair

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.860
and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.700
you just pick one of them

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.440
and say

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.040
this is my public key

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.980
right and your public key

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:17.660
is public

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.960
you publish it everywhere

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.800
you put it

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.340
you put it at the end of emails

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.420
your forum posts

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.480
you...you upload it to keyserver

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.360
just specialized serve system designed for

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.040
storing, securely storing people public keys

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.640
basic idea is it's everywhere out

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.400
there in the world with your name on it

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.460
the private key

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.700
is the other key of this pair

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.740
that one you keep absolutely secret

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.820
you can do some cool things with this once you have system setup

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.120
i have a key pair

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.280
you have a key pair

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.840
we both have one another public key

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.620
so now if you want to send me a message

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.780
i don't have to share anything with you

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.240
you just know my public key

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.100
encrypt something with my public key

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.340
send it to me

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.340
you know i can decrypt it

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.460
because i have my private key

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.640
and then there's another thing you can do with this

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.660
which is

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.180
if i encrypt something with my private key

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.660
and then publish it

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.380
now on the surface you may think what is the point

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.360
of encrypting it

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.060
with your private key

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.820
because your public key is out there and anything can decrypt it

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.320
so why bother encrypting

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.200
but

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.840
the fact that it can be decrypted with your public key

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.640
means it must have been encrypted with your private key

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.600
which it must have been you who made the message

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.760
because only you have your private key

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.340
cryptographically you can be certain

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.580
that it's an authentic message really from that person

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.580
so the best thing is that when I do both

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.420
where i encrypt something from my private key

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.160
and then your public key

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.480
and then send it to you

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.400
and if we communicate like this

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.700
i know that no body else gonna read the message

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.580
you know that no body else can read the message

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.220
you know that message is come from me, not an impostor

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.560
you also know that the message hasn't been modified

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.660
because any modification to the message also require the keys

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.020
that's a great secure system and

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.640
we didn't have to meet up in the park

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.300
in a secret way

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.080
and exchange any information or anything

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.700
we never have met

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.700
i need to make clear here that I have oversimplified in various ways

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.880
people who understands cryptography will be quiet

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.820
upset

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.340
probably

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.880
by now

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.220
but guys this is

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.260
this is why people don't use crypto

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.220
because we make it to complicated

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.680
core concept is simple

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.340
and basic stuff isn't it difficult to use

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.560
and everyone should

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.680
when you put envelope in the post

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.820
you kind of assume

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.140
you lick the things to seal it

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.660
and if it's been open

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.780
people will know it's been open

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.800
and there is laws about this

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.200
and we have to know these stuffs

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.120
when you communicate in the clear

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.880
you know anyone and his dog can know exactly what you're sending to everyone

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.980
and there's no reason to allow that
